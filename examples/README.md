### API & Protocols

- **[swarms_api_examples/](swarms_api_examples/)** - Swarms API usage examples including agent overview, batch processing, client integration, team examples, analysis, and rate limiting.

- **[mcp/](mcp/)** - Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration examples including agent implementations, multi-connection setups, server configurations, and utility functions.

- **[aop_examples/](aop_examples/)** - Agents over Protocol (AOP) examples demonstrating MCP server setup, agent discovery, client interactions, queue-based task submission, and medical AOP implementations.

### Advanced Capabilities

- **[reasoning_agents/](reasoning_agents/)** - Advanced reasoning capabilities including agent judge evaluation systems, O3 model integration, and mixture of agents (MOA) sequential examples.

- **[rag/](rag/)** - Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) implementations with vector database integrations including Qdrant examples.
