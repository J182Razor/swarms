"""
Comprehensive test suite for Board of Directors Swarm.

This module contains extensive tests for the Board of Directors swarm implementation,
covering all aspects including initialization, board operations, task execution,
error handling, and performance characteristics.

Tests follow the example.py pattern with real agents and multiple agent scenarios.
