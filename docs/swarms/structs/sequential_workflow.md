# SequentialWorkflow Documentation

**Overview:**
A Sequential Swarm architecture processes tasks in a linear sequence. Each agent completes its task before passing the result to the next agent in the chain. This architecture ensures orderly processing and is useful when tasks have dependencies.

**Use-Cases:**

- Workflows where each step depends on the previous one, such as assembly lines or sequential data processing.
- Scenarios requiring strict order of operations.
- Multi-step content creation, analysis, and refinement workflows.

## Usage Examples

### Basic Sequential Workflow

This example demonstrates a simple two-agent workflow for researching and writing a blog post.

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Agent 1: The Researcher
researcher = Agent(
    agent_name="Researcher",
    system_prompt="Your job is to research the provided topic and provide a detailed summary.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Agent 2: The Writer
writer = Agent(
    agent_name="Writer",
    system_prompt="Your job is to take the research summary and write a beautiful, engaging blog post about it.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",
)

# Create a sequential workflow where the researcher's output feeds into the writer's input
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[researcher, writer])

# Run the workflow on a task
final_post = workflow.run("The history and future of artificial intelligence")
print(final_post)
```

### Legal Practice Workflow

This example shows how to create a sequential workflow with multiple specialized legal agents.

from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Litigation Agent
litigation_agent = Agent(
    agent_name="Alex Johnson",
    system_prompt="As a Litigator, you specialize in navigating the complexities of lawsuits. Your role involves analyzing intricate facts, constructing compelling arguments, and devising effective case strategies to achieve favorable outcomes for your clients.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini",

swarm.run("Create a report on how to patent an all-new AI invention and what platforms to use and more.")
```

### Startup Idea Validation Workflow

# 1. Generate an idea
idea_generator = Agent(
    agent_name="IdeaGenerator",
    system_prompt="Generate a unique startup idea.",
    model_name="gpt-4o-mini"

# Run the workflow
elevator_pitch = workflow.run("Generate and validate a startup idea in the AI space")
print(elevator_pitch)
```

### Advanced: Materials Science Workflow

```python
from swarms import Agent, SequentialWorkflow

# Chief Metallurgist
chief_metallurgist = Agent(
    agent_name="Chief-Metallurgist",
    system_prompt="As the Chief Metallurgist, you oversee the entire alloy development process, analyzing atomic structure, phase diagrams, and composition development.",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_loops=1,
)

    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_loops=1,
)

# Quality Assurance Specialist
qa_specialist = Agent(
    agent_name="QA-Specialist",
    system_prompt="As the QA Specialist, you establish quality standards, testing protocols, and documentation requirements.",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_loops=1,
)

# Applications Engineer
applications_engineer = Agent(
    agent_name="Applications-Engineer",

    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_loops=1,
)

# Cost Analyst
cost_analyst = Agent(
    agent_name="Cost-Analyst",
    system_prompt="As the Cost Analyst, you evaluate material costs, production costs, and economic viability.",
    model_name="gpt-4o",
    max_loops=1,
)

# Create the agent list
agents = [
    chief_metallurgist,
    materials_scientist,
    process_engineer,
    qa_specialist,
    applications_engineer,
    cost_analyst,
]

# Initialize the workflow
swarm = SequentialWorkflow(
    name="alloy-development-system",
    agents=agents,
)

# Run the workflow
result = swarm.run(
    """Analyze and develop a new high-strength aluminum alloy for aerospace applications
    with improved fatigue resistance and corrosion resistance compared to 7075-T6,
    while maintaining similar density and cost effectiveness."""
)
print(result)
```

## Configuration Options

### Agent Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `agent_name` | Human-readable name for the agent | Required |
| `system_prompt` | Detailed role description and expertise | Required |
| `model_name` | LLM model to use | "gpt-4o-mini" |
| `max_loops` | Maximum number of processing loops | 1 |

### Workflow Parameters

| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `agents` | List of agents to execute in sequence | Required |
| `name` | Name of the workflow | "SequentialWorkflow" |
| `description` | Description of workflow purpose | Standard description |
| `max_loops` | Number of times to execute workflow | 1 |
| `team_awareness` | Enable sequential awareness features | False |

## Best Practices

1. **Clear Agent Roles**: Give each agent a specific, well-defined role with a detailed system prompt.
2. **Ordered Dependencies**: Arrange agents in an order that makes sense for your workflow (e.g., research before writing).
3. **Agent Names**: Use descriptive agent names that clearly indicate their function.
4. **System Prompts**: Write comprehensive system prompts that explain the agent's expertise and responsibilities.
5. **Task Clarity**: Provide clear, specific tasks when calling `run()`.

## Logging and Error Handling

The `run` method includes comprehensive logging to track workflow execution:

```bash
2023-05-08 10:30:15.456 | INFO | Sequential Workflow Name: SequentialWorkflow is ready to run.
```

All errors during execution are logged and re-raised for proper error handling.

## Accessing Workflow Information

The `SequentialWorkflow` automatically creates a flow string showing the agent execution order:

```python
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3])
print(workflow.flow)  # Output: "Agent1 -> Agent2 -> Agent3"
```

## Advanced Features

### Team Awareness

Enable `team_awareness=True` to provide agents with context about their position in the workflow (this feature is managed by the internal `AgentRearrange` object):

```python
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(
    agents=[researcher, writer, editor],
    team_awareness=True,
)
```

### Multi-Agent Collaboration Prompt

Set `multi_agent_collab_prompt=True` to automatically append a collaboration prompt to each agent's system prompt:

```python
workflow = SequentialWorkflow(
    agents=[agent1, agent2, agent3],
    multi_agent_collab_prompt=True,
)
```

## Notes

- The `SequentialWorkflow` internally uses `AgentRearrange` to manage agent execution.
- Each agent receives the output of the previous agent as its input.
- The workflow executes agents in the exact order they appear in the `agents` list.
- The workflow is designed for production use with comprehensive error handling and logging.
- For parallel execution, consider using `ConcurrentWorkflow` or `SpreadSheetSwarm` instead.
